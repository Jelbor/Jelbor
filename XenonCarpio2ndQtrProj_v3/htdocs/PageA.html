		<h3 id="h3b">Life Cycle of A Star</h3>
	<p id="p1">The Sun is a massive object. It is basically a huge ball of fire. 
	It makes up almost all the mass of the Solar System. 
	The sun sustains heat, light, energy and life on Earth. 
	Because it is so massive, it burns hydrogen that is eventually compressed helium due to the immense pressure in its core.
	This process is called thermonuclear fusion.
	The temperature of the Sun's core is around 15 million degrees but only about 10 thousand degrees on the surface.
	The 8 planets revolves around the Sun as the Sun moves around the Milkyway galaxy.
	The planets orbit the Sun due to it's gravitational force.
	You may find the Sun to be an enourmous object, but it is just a spec of dust when compared to other giants.
	</p>
	<p id="p2">All the other stars are just like the Sun, burning hot and brightly. 
	It's just the distance that makes them look small. Some are bigger some are smaller than the Sun. 
	Some are also brighter and hotter. Their general temperature can be inferred by observing their color.
	With red being the least hot and blue being the hotttest.</p>
	<p id="p3">A life of a star starts with a Nebula. 
	A main sequence star is formed from a Nebula, they either become a normal star os a massive star. 
	Starting from the normal stars, as they age, they expand and becomes reddish as they ran out of gas. 
	Then it dies and turns into a Planetary Nebula, until what's left of it is just a white dwarf. 
	On the other side of the spectrum, when a massive star is formed.
	It is hotter and brighter.
	It also expands as it lose fuel overtime.
	But when it dies, in a form of a SuperNova.
	It either becomes a super dense star also known as a neutron star,
	or the densest heavenly body also known as a blackhole.</p>
