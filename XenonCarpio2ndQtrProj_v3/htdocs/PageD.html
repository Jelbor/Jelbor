	<p id="p1">Galaxies are systems of stars. They contain a few billions to hundreds of billions of stars and another hundred billion planets. They are bounded by the gravitaional forces of a supermega blackhole in the center.
		The Solar system belongs to the Milky way galaxy. And the Sun orbits the blackhole in the middle of our galaxy every 230 million years. We can describe galaxies from their characteristics, 
		like their shape and size. A galaxy like the Milky way is a spiral galaxy. Some galaxies are elliptical, irregular, barred, peculiar or lenticular in shape. 
	</p>
	<p id="p2">Heavenly bodies proved great importance as a part of a ever growing system of these celestial bodies. These sizes dwarfs Earth in an exponential level.
		From the smallest planetoids we know to the host of everything we know. This shows us how far we have come in exploring beyond what we can see and how miniscule are we from the capabilities of nature.
	</p>
	<p id="p3">Universe is the summation of all the galaxies and matter that we could observe. Even space ends in the limits of the universe. It has been theorized that all laws and constants come with its universe. 
		And having multiple universe, hence the term multiverse. May mean that for each different universe is a different way of how they work in terms of physics and mechanisms. 
		But there is also a chance of having the same contents between these universe with just the tiny difference between them. We may not be able to prove them all, but we are free to theorize whats beyond of what we can perceive. 
		This scale demonstates the magnitude of the possibilities outside our home planet and the science of universes.
