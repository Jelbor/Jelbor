	<p id="p1">The Terrestrial planets of the Solar sysytem. They have solid surfaces, and are the first four closest planets from the Sun. 
		Namely, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because they are closer to the Sun, they have a shorter orbit. Mercury having the shortest orbit, one revolution around the Sun only takes about 88 Earth days.
		Then Venus on the other hand is the second closest from the Sun, with one revolution only taking about 225 Earth days. 
		The third planet is obviously Earth having the standard 365 days per one complete revolution. Lastly we have Mars, taking about 687 Earth days to complete one revolution around the Sun.

	<p id="p2">Planets are basically spherical objects in space. Either orbiting a parent star or going rogue. They are typically composed of a core mantle and a crust or surface. 
		But some may be composed of gas, like the gas giants of our Solar system.
	</p>
	<p id="p3">The gas giants, the biggest planets of the Solar system . They are mostly made of gas, like hydrogen, helium and other gasses.  
		Jupiter, the biggest of all planets in the Solar system has a thick layer of gas with turbulent winds and storms going around for a few thousands of years.  
		It has a beautiful ring composed of rock, dust, and ice particles. Seconding Jupiter, we have saturn, the most elegant of them all. It has the most vibrant ring out of all the planets. 
		After Saturn is Uranus, a unique planet as it has its ring around it vertically. Its poles are tilted almost 90 degrees to the side. 
		And lastly, the farthest from the Sun, Neptune. Nothing is much to be said from this planet, other than it's rich blue color. Well it might not be obvious but all of them have a lot of satellites. 
		When we compare them to the inner planets they have much more, ranging from 14 to 83 moons per planet.
