		<h3 id="h3b">Rings and Natural Satellites</h3>
	<p id="p1">Asteriods are interplanetary space rocks orbiting the Sun. They have huge orbits, and regularly comes close to the Sun. 
		These rocks are left over parts from the creation of the Solar system. And also possibly, chunks of rocks from the planets. 
		On the other hand, a meteoroid is a piece or part of the bigger asteroid. When this piece of rock is headed towards a planet, it may be called a meteoroid.
		When this piece of rock is in the atmosphere of a planet, it is called a meteor. But when it survives and reaches the surface of the planet, it is called a meteorite.
	</p>
	<p id="p2">Satellites, or what we commonly know as moons are celestial bodies that orbit a planet. Though their formation is still unclear. 
		Scientist have theorized that these satellites formed when another celestial body collided with the planet. What's left of that collission is the moon and the planet.
		While some parts of it are left to wonder around the Solar system. The moons structure is also like a planet, it has a core in a center. 
		Although it is not as dense as the ones on a planet.</p>
	<p id="p3">Rings and satellites are a product of a collision between two celestial bodies. 
		After a collision, things start to break apart and some of the parts are stuck in the gravitational field of the surviving celestial body. 
		It forms an orbit around the parent planet. While rings are just the small remains of the collision that surrounds the planet. 
		A satellite proves great valuability on its parent planet. Just like the moon, it may provide an external gravitional force outside of the planet. 
		To help in the formation of tides just like here on Earth. It also provides natural light during night times.</p>
